### Core Business Model
- **40+ Mood Boards** with 5 models each (200+ total models)
- **5-Day Week View** calendar interface for browsing
- **10% Upfront Payment** with milestone-based completion
- **Phone/OTP Authentication** for secure access
- **Admin-Curated Content** for quality control

- **CDN**: Vercel Edge Network
- **Browser Caching**: Proper cache headers

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Local Development
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
3. Configure environment variables
4. Run database schema in Supabase
5. Start development server with `pnpm dev`

### Database Management
1. Schema changes via SQL files
2. Migration scripts for updates
3. Seed data through admin panel
4. RLS policies for security

### Deployment Process
1. Automatic deployment via Vercel
2. Environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Database updates via Supabase dashboard
4. DNS and domain management

## 📈 Scalability Considerations
